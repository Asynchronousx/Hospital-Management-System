*** 1. DEPARTMENT CREATION ***
To generate a department, just run into the terminal
the generate department script with name, port and ip 
information, along with the database one:

template: ./generate_department.sh <Dep Name> <Port> <Ip> <Root PSW> <User DB> <Pass User DB>

example of use: ./generate_department.sh Pediatry 7777 127.0.0.1 rootPsw* UserName userPsw*

this will create a folder containing all the necessary file
to initialize a department, already compiled and ready to run, 
and also the database the file will use to store it's visits.

*** 2. RUN DEPARTMENT ***
Last phase, is to send the department ONLINE.
we could do this simply opening a terminal into our desired folder
and type:

./<Department Name>

Once done, our department will be online.
